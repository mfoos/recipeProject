# Sensory Recipe Access

Essentially the goal is to create an engine capable of recommending me a
"cheesy" recipe when I ask for one.

Plan
* Scrape a trusted, curated recipe blog (with permission)
* Create an SQL database to hold the recipe skeleton (title, tags, ingredients)
* Use keyword search & supervised ML to create subjective descriptors (like
  "cheesy") for searching on
* Implement a simple front end for db
* Iterate
